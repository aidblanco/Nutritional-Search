to use this site you just need to use npm and next.js

for this project the noted resources I used are tailwind, shadcn-ui (a ui componenents library), and the spoonacular API.

1. What are the design principles of your site? (Color pallette, fonts, layout, etc.)

    The CSS for my project was created using Tailwind
    For the design of my project I used a white background with green accents for some of the UI components.
    this is what i used for my font:
    ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol", "Noto Color Emoji"
    The layout of my site contains a searching section with multiple inputs on the left. And on the right you can
    see the results of your search based on the inputed parameters


2. What is the purpose of your site? Why does it need to exist?

    The purpose of my site is to provide recipes for people with different nutritional needs. If someone has any
    intolerances, specific cuisines they would like to eat on a certain day, a certain amount of calories they want to eat, 
    type of dish, etc... they are able to narrow down their results and find the perfect recipe for theirn needs which can save
    people time. 


3. Does your site look good on multiple screen sizes

    Correct, so if you are using a smaller device such as a mobile device the resulting dishes will be moved lower so that
    you can still read the results and it looks clean and professional. 

4. What is the Netlify URL of your site

    https://velvety-lily-1fda0b.netlify.app

5. How does your site use state to keep track of user interaction?

    UseState uses an object containing all of the filters and it is able to keep track of user interactions through this. 

6. Does your site fetch data from:  an internal source? a third party API?

    My site fetches data from a third party API called spoonacular

7. Does your site persist data using a third-party tool or database

    My site is able to maintain the data using the third party API and does not use a third party tool or database to store the information
